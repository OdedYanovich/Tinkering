The sound of the ordered-set/limit output will be a mix of 2 sounds:
- The sound that is associated with the requested input-function-usage/ordered-set
- The sound that is associated with the player's input-function-usage/ordered-set
That will meet 2 requirements:
- Player's choice will be acknowledged
- Closeness to the request will sound better

Side Note - Each possible variant of input-function-usage/ordered-set and input-function/output is associated with a different variation of the same sound
