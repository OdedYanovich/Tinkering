"Not Here" is an alternative instruction that was meant to be mixed with the current "Here".
Not Here restrict the player from pressing the associated button.

Here associated aren't available for Not Here instructions.
Not Here associated and unassociated are available for Not Here instructions but Not Here associated including the exception of the button associated with said instruction.

Each Not Here's associated set can be determined by excluding Here associated or including Not Here members. Those ways require excluding the button associated with the current Not Here. Each button can be replaced with an unassociated button that is known to be safe.

The act of determining a set might require players to examine the entire Command (unlike a Command that only contain Here, in which each instruction can be acted upon immediately).
