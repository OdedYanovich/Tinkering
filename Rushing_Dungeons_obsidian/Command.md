A command is a $\mathbb{N}$ long list of letters and numbers that tells the player which [[Action]] will give [[Progress]]. [[Rushing Dungeons 1 Goal#^command-goal|Why?]]

A command is made, kept then checked. [[Rushing Dungeons 1 Goal#^response-pipeline|Why?]]

# Command Making
Every command in the [[Encounter]] will follow [[Encounter Handler|criteria]] like:
- How many buttons are tracked by an [[Action]]
- How many presses are needed for an [[Action]]
- The [[#Instruction]]s that might be in the command
[[Rushing Dungeons 1 Goal#^possibility-space|why?]]

The [[Command]]'s buttons will be distributed randomly across the [[Action]]s with the [[#instruction]]s associated with them randomly. [[Rushing Dungeons 1 Goal#^random-command|Why?]]
