i(x) = x is an instruction,
$\forall d(c\in d\Longrightarrow i(d)$ [[|Why?]]

$\forall d(i\in d\Longrightarrow c(d)$ [[miscellaneous#^command-goal|Why?]]

c(x) = x is current

# Criteria
A set of commands that an [[Encounter]] may require.

The command buttons will be distributed randomly across the [[Action]]s with the [[#instruction]]s associated with them randomly. [[miscellaneous#^random-command|Why?]]

# instruction
There are 3 types of instructions:
- Here
- Not Here
- Mix

# Command Making
## declaration

## definition
