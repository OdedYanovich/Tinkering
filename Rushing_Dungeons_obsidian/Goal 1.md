Rushing Dungeons is made for the gameplay and everything else is the game around the core mechanics that will make it work.

Gameplay is assumed to compel by instructing the player to press the buttons (or any other from of input but in this docs the input method will always be referred to as buttons) correctly.

The game response to presses only in a sequence that are called [[Action]]s in order to make it easier to reason about the ideal requirement for the presses.

The requirements are called [[Command]]s and they are displayed as a list of characters for ease of implementation and removing ambiguity.

Every [[Action]] will contain elements that are unique from each other to prevent double presses.

The buttons will be held until the [[Action]] is completed to make the uniqueness of the presses intuitive, to let the player cancel an [[Action]] by releasing a button and to feel different then rhythm games.

The fastest reaction to a [[Command]] is always incentivised in order to offer every player the opportunity to push his limits and to let him finish an easy [[Encounter]] as fast as possible.
