The Dungeon is the main menu of the game. [[Dungeon#^necessary-state|why?]]
Hear you can:
- Pick an encounter. (Regular/[[Boss]]) [[Encounter#^dungeon-role|why?]]
- Accept a [[Challenge]].
- Switch a [[Layer]].
- Change the [[Options]].
- Accept "Double Treble" (doble [[Hp]] gain and lost for the next [[Encounter]]). Why?

# Why
Encounters are tense, Dungeons aren't, there isn't a reason to add additional states for the game beyond an options menu.
