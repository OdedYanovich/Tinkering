The game start with only the first layer.
Ones done the run will restart at the next layer.
The player can switch between all of the layers that he started at the cost of his progress in the current run. [[Layer#^escalation|why?]]

Every layer has 3 [[Floor]]s 
Beating a layer unlocks a new color [[Color Scheme]] and a new [[font]] for the player.
# introduction
The first Layer's criterion will own a single member each that introduce the mechanics (all [[Command#Relations|relations]] with 1 and 2 presses). They will be a lot less punishing until the last 1 that will use all of them with the regular mechanics.

The next Layers will expend the criteria until it will reach a limit then the criteria will increase instead of expand (the usual).
