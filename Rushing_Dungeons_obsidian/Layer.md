# introduction
The first Layer's criterion will own a single member each that introduce the mechanics (all [[Command#Relations|relations]] with 1 and 2 presses). They will be a lot less punishing until the last 1 that will use all of them with the regular mechanics.

The next Layers will expend the criteria until it will reach a limit then the criteria will increase instead of expand (the usual).
