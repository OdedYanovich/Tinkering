The player is instructed to press the buttons according to [[Command]]s during an [[Encounter]]. [[Reasoning#^compelling|Why?]] 

Button presses are converted to [[Action]]s before passing onwards.

Each [[Command]] is displayed as a list of characters. [[Reasoning#^char|Why?]] 
^command-goal

 During an [[Encounter]], one [[Command]] is showed until a responding [[Action]]. [[Reasoning#^pipelline|Why?]] 
^response-pipeline

The keys in an [[Action]] are unique and irrelevant until the Action is full. [[Reasoning#^double-press|Why?]] 

Faster reaction is incentivised during an [[Encounter]]. [[Reasoning#^reaction-time|Why?]] 

[[Action]]s can track more buttons and demand more presses to increase the possibility space and thus make more mistakes possible.

[[Encounter]]s distinguishing themselves from each other. [[Reasoning#^repatation|Why?]] 
^level

A [[Command]] limits the set of wanted [[Action]]s by associating/disassociating a buttons with an order
^instructions

A [[Command]] is displayed left to right in the order of presses. Numbers may will be written before them to indicate that the letter skips spots in the order of presses.

The order of the buttons and the associated [[Command#instruction|Instructions]] are randomized in order to force the player to determine a correct [[Action]] from the entire possibility space for every [[Command]] under time pressure.  
^random-command

 Memorable events and  repetition resistant decision making will be achieved with tools like randomness.
^identity

The game will escalate in difficulty for as long as players will push through the [[status#Boss|Bosses]].
^escalation

Hp/progress is an incentive for:
Faster reaction to commands.
Taking risks.
^incentive

Players that are too good for the [[Encounter]]s there facing could progress faster then others and to make them more interesting with [[Challenge]]s.
