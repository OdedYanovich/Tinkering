The core of the game is the Encounter. 

The [[Dungeon]]'s main function is a breather between encounters and to give them in a satisfying order. [[Goal 1#^simplicity|why?]]

The player will receive [[Hp]] for participation, but throughout the encounter, said hp will tick down, once it runs out, so dose the run. [[Encounter#^hp|why?]]

At any moment, the player is instructed, and once he [[Action|acts]],
[[Progress]] is effected by the whether $Action \in Command$  then the [[Command]] is replaced. [[Goal 1#^simplicity|why?]]

 Ones [[Progress]] reach 100% the encounter ends and the player returns to the dungeon
 
# Why

Hp is used to incentivise faster reaction to commands without locking progress behind any challenge but incompetence will still be punished with reptation (the roguelike way)
