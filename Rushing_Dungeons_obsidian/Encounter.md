The core of the game is the Encounter. 

The [[Dungeon]]'s main function is a breather between encounters and to give them in a satisfying order. [[Encounter#^simplicity|why?]]
^dungeon-role

The player will receive [[Hp]] for participation, but through the encounter, said hp will tick down, once it runs out, so dose the run. [[Encounter#^hp|why?]]

At any moment, the player is instructed, and once he [[Action|acts]],
[[Progress]] is effected by the whether $Action \in Command$  then the [[Command]] is replaced. [[Encounter#^simplicity|why?]]

 Ones the Progress reach 100% the encounter ends and the player returns to the dungeon
 
# Why
Certain form of gameplay is the goal of the project and everything else is the game around the core mechanics.  
^main-mechanics

Hp is used to incentivise faster reactions without locking progress behind any challenge but to punish incompetence with reptation (the roguelike way)

The game is influenced by 2 assumptions:
- Skills in most games is the ability to determine the correct sequence of buttons from the visuals.
- Framing a property as a subject of the design and excluding others can achieve unique results.
[[Action]]s are those sequences and [[Command]]s are the simplest visuals that can distinct sequences from others.
